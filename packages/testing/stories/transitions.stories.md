# Transitions

```js script
export default {
  title: 'Utils/Testing/Transitions',
};
```

This is a set of testing helpers to make transitions easier to test. Some browsers don't fire the transitionEnd event when they run in headless mode, this util intends to help the developer to test propperly on that case.
